This subdirectory contains run-time libraries built with the following 
compilers:

Compiler                        platform.mk     lib subdir
------------------------------  --------------  ---------------------
GNU gcc 3.3.1 (default)         platform.gcc3   libgcc3 / lib_optgcc3
GNU gcc 2.95.3                  platform.gcc2   libgcc2 / lib_optgcc2

Optimized libraries are located in lib_optXXXX directories (not available in
evaluation and SDK kits).

To change the run-time library configuration, do the following: 

1. Change the 'lib' symbolic link to point at the lib subdir. 
2. Change the 'platform.mk' link to point at the platform.mk file.

For example, to change to 32-bit libs built with the gcc 2.95.3 compiler:

rm lib platform.mk
ln -s libgcc2 lib
ln -s platform.gcc2 platform.mk
